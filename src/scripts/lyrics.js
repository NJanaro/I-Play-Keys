"He made an enemy, then\n\
He made an enemy of all of you\n\
It's him, not you\n\
You never heard it from me\n\
But there's a breach in the hull\n\
Where the truth and the water's too deep to prove\n\
newLine\n\
He made an enemy, then\n\
He made an enemy of all of you\n\
It's him, not you\n\
It's a little red sea- let the miracle worker go free\n\
See the paddle go up and the paddle go down\n\
And the paddle go up and the paddle go down\n\
And the paddle go up and the paddle go down\n\
And the man falls in the sea\n\

He was a man of many nations\n\
Had a hundred souls and a hundred to go\n\
He was a man of many nations\n\
Two hearts, two hands, it's a slippery slope\n\
He had a fear of being naked\n\
But you're any other man in another man's clothes\n\
He was a man of many nations\n\
With revelations, oh, revelations\n\
newLine\n\
He wrote a book about the Bible\n\
And he wrote a book about men in the sky\n\
He wrote a book about the smell of winter\n\
Then two, a little less simple to decipher\n\
Saying, “I am the water at the foot of the palms\n\
Oh, I'm sand and wind and a shitty mirage\n\
But either way, I'm a man of many nations!”\n\

Was it the mending of the gown\n\
Or the running it around?\n\
Was it the mending of the gown\n\
Or the running and the running it around?\n\
newLine\n\
She had a name, she had a spirit\n\
She had a line in the play, if you waited to hear it\n\
But a master of disguises\n\
Her demise was her design, they said\n\
Was it the mending of the gown\n\
Or the running, and the running, and the running it around?\n\
newLine\n\
She said, 'My name and my spirit are both corrupt\n\
And if you hold me close, you gotta hold me up'\n\
It was the tender mending of this slender gown\n\
That brought me bending to the ground\n\
Now you'll wear any old thing\n\
Oh, you'll wear any old thing\n\
newLine\n\
So she wrapped herself in swaddling\n\
That the fever deviated to a broken wing\n\
It's an act, I think she's just pretending\n\
It's an act, I think, she's just pretending\n\
If you burn the virgin flags, then I will shake (Shake!)\n\
As the heat waves in the sand\n\
This one's for Maggie (This one's for Maggie!)\n\
This one's for Sam (This one's for Sam!)\n\
This one's for Maggie (This one's for Maggie!)\n\
This one's for Sam (This one's for Sam!)\n\
Or any other random spirit lover busted\n\
I have lusted after you\n\
newLine\n\
The way bloodsuckers do!\n\
The way bloodsuckers do!\n\
The way bloodsuckers do!\n\

Was it the mending of the gown\n\
Or the running it around?\n\
Was it the mending of the gown\n\
Or the running, and the running\n\
And the running, and the running it around?\n\
newLine\n\
It was the tender mending of this slender gown\n\
That brought me bending to the ground\n\
But this ship was built to go down\n\
See the paddle go up and the paddle go down!\n\
And the paddle go up and the paddle go down!\n\
And the paddle go up and the paddle go down!\n\
And the paddle go up and the paddle go down!"

So you say it's the hair of ghosts\n\
So I say it's the white hair of Poseidon\n\
Ebbing in the tide in some dead sea\n\

So you say it's some Shroud of Turin\n\
And the sun wore it white and the earth wore it thin\n\
Or the son wore it white and his faith wore it thin\n\
Unraveling heavenward\n\
It's saddled to tiny birds\n\

Either way they are struggling\n\
Either way they are miniature\n\
Either way they're invisible\n\

And the pattern of flight is chaotic and blind\n\
But it's right cause chaos is yours and it's mine\n\
And chaos is luck and luck: love and love: blind\n\

But they're subject to hating us\n\
Oh, just like the rest of us\n\
Oh, but just like the best of us\n\
They need the rest of us to stay alive\n\
So thats not where confusion lies\n\
That's not where an allusion to the fact that the truth\n\
Is just smoke in your eyes does lie\n\

Confusion lies in which other wicked things to lie with\n\
Confusion lies in which other wicked things to lie with\n\
And chaos is yours, and chaos is mine\n\
