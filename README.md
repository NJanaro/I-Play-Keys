## I Play Keys is a fun typing game for fans of Sunset Rubdown. Play along to the songs of Random Spirit Lover and try to keep the darkness from consuming you. 

A random track from Sunset Rubdown's "Random Spirit Lover" plays while the lyrics are presented for you to type. You have the option to mute the song if you wish.

The animated darkness circles in on your character and you must keep the lyics flowing to keep the darkness at bay. There is no room for mistakes, so be sure to correct your errors or the circle will continue to close on you.

### Technologies used:
1. Canvas used to animate closing darkness and piano man animations
2. Javascript handle all user input and gameplay
